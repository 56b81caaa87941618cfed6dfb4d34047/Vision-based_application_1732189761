Implemented functions for staking (stake), withdrawing (withdraw), and checking stakes (getStake).\n3. Added a function to get the total staked amount (getTotalStaked).\n4. Used OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard to protect against reentrancy attacks and Ownable for basic access control.\n5. Emitted events for Staked and Withdrawn actions to allow for easy monitoring of the contract.\n\nAssumptions and caveats:\n- The contract does not implement a reward mechanism. If you want to add rewards in the future, you'll need to modify the contract.\n- The contract uses Solidity 0.8.20's built-in overflow protection, so explicit SafeMath usage is not necessary.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy it to the HOLESKY network.\n2. Users can stake ETH by calling the stake() function and sending ETH along with the transaction.\n3. Users can withdraw their staked ETH by calling the withdraw() function with the amount they wish to withdraw.\n4. Anyone can check a user's stake by calling getStake() with the user's address.\n5. The total staked amount can be checked by calling getTotalStaked().\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to the mainnet, and consider having it audited for security if you plan to use it with significant amounts of ETH.\n",

Users can stake a minimum of 0.1 ETH for a fixed duration of 30 days.\n2. The reward rate is set to 10% APR.\n3. Users can only have one active stake at a time.\n4. Rewards are calculated based on the staking duration, up to a maximum of 30 days.\n5. The contract includes functions for staking, withdrawing, calculating rewards, and viewing stake information.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract uses a simplified reward calculation and fixed staking period.\n- There's no owner or admin functionality to change parameters or withdraw contract funds.\n- The contract doesn't compound rewards; they are calculated linearly.\n\nTo interact with the contract:\n1. Deploy the contract on the HOLESKY network.\n2. Use the `stake()` function to stake ETH (send at least 0.1 ETH with the transaction).\n3. After 30 days, use the `withdraw()` function to retrieve your stake and rewards.\n4. You can check your stake info anytime using the `getStakeInfo()` function.\n\nRemember, this is a basic implementation for testing purposes on HOLESKY. For a production environment, additional security measures and more complex reward mechanisms would be necessary.\n",

Created a contract that counts clicks and allows sending the count as transactions on the HOLESKY network.\n2. Implemented functions to increment clicks, get the current click count, and send the click count.\n3. Used OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract for access control on the sendClickCount function.\n4. Added events to log when clicks are incremented and when the click count is sent.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The sendClickCount function doesn't actually send a transaction on the blockchain. It emits an event to simulate this action. In a real-world scenario, you might want to implement actual transaction sending logic based on your specific requirements.\n- The contract can be deployed on the HOLESKY network without any changes to the code.\n\nTo interact with the contract:\n1. Deploy the contract on the HOLESKY network.\n2. Use the incrementClicks function to increase the click count.\n3. Use getClickCount to retrieve the current count.\n4. The contract owner can use sendClickCount to emit an event with the current click count.\n\nRemember to handle events on the frontend or in your monitoring system to track click increments and when the click count is \"sent\".\n",

Updated the ABI to accurately reflect the contract's functions.\n2. Implemented the three main functions: queryZKPay, cancelQuery, and withdraw.\n3. Created an interface that allows the owner to interact with these functions.\n4. Displayed relevant information such as contract balance and query hash.\n5. Implemented error handling for all interactions.\n\nThe component now sends the correct amount of ETH (0.01 ETH) when querying ZKPay, which covers the maximum possible recipients (10 * 0.001 ETH).\n\nPlease note that this component is designed to be used only by the contract owner, as all main functions have the `onlyOwner` modifier in the smart contract. The UI will only display the action buttons if the connected wallet is the owner's address.\n\nAlso, make sure to have sufficient ETH in your wallet when querying ZKPay, as it requires sending 0.01 ETH with the transaction.\n",

The contract includes access control to ensure only the data owner can modify or retrieve their data.\n4. Events are emitted for all major actions (storing, updating, and deleting data).\n5. The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's Ownable, allowing for potential future upgrades or emergency functions.\n\nCaveats and considerations:\n- Be mindful of gas costs when storing large amounts of data.\n- The emergencyClearAllData function is included but left empty. Implement it with caution as it can delete all user data.\n- There's no limit on data size, so consider implementing a size limit if needed.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract to your chosen Ethereum network.\n2. Users can call storeData to save their data, retrieveData to fetch it, updateData to modify it, and deleteData to remove it.\n3. Only the contract owner can call the emergencyClearAllData function (if implemented).\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to a mainnet environment.\n",

Deploy the contract (no constructor arguments needed).\n2. Use the `storeData` function to store data.\n3. Use the `retrieveData` function to retrieve your stored data.\n4. Use the `deleteData` function to delete your stored data.\n\nRemember that all transactions on the blockchain are public, so while only the owner can retrieve their data directly from the contract, the data itself is visible on the blockchain.\n",
